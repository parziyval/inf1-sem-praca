PROJECT TITLE: Knight chess game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: to get an A in Informatics
VERSION or DATE: 7.12.2019
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: just click on the "Knight.jar" icon in this folder
AUTHORS: Adam Parimucha
USER INSTRUCTIONS: You will be moving chess piece called knight on chessboard.
To win the game you have to visit all tiles on chessboard, but you can't step 
on one tile twice.
Knights can move to a square that is two squares away horizontally and 
one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. 
The complete move therefore looks like the letter "L".
For some reason sometimes you have to click one tile several times to move there
even if it's legal move (idk why).
Please don't let this discourage you.
